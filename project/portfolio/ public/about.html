          Meet Spikey Sanju: Designer, Engineer, and ADHD-Inspired Innovator!
        </h1>
        <p>
          Hey there, I'm Sanju, and people often ask me what I do...Hey there, I'm Sanju, and people often ask me what I do. I tell them that I'm a designer and an engineer, which essentially means I practice UXE (User Experience Engineering). My passion is designing and building things that make people's lives easier. From a young age, I've been self-taught in the field of design and development. I have a deep love for learning and always seek out new challenges to improve my skills. I'm particularly enthusiastic about open-source projects and have contributed a lot to the community. My passion for open-source led me to create numerous open-source projects that have helped many people. One of my significant accomplishments was becoming a Google Developer Expert in Android. I have the expertise to create amazing things for Android devices and have even contributed to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). It's a huge achievement in my field, and I'm particularly proud of it. In addition to these pursuits, I'm the founder of a design studio called THISUX, where I work hard to create designs that can change the world. Currently, I'm also building two SaaS products, SticAI and AboGrow, which aim to help people make their lives more comfortable. I believe that any idea, no matter how small or big, can change the world. I'm passionate about making a difference in people's lives through innovative and creative ideas. My love for design and engineering drives me to work tirelessly towards realizing these goals. You can find me here Link to all my social media accounts. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
